          'Lauded as one of the most ethnically diverse governments in history, Boris Johnson’s “ cabinet for modern Britain ” was received with much fanfare. It was positioned as a bold, nation building exercise for the Brexiting state. A racially diverse cabinet, the story went, was an indicator that Boris’s Britain had progressed from the days of Enoch Powell and “ No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs ” signs. But this was a myth, reliant on the misguided belief that any representation was a sign of progress. His government is anything but progressive. The Home Secretary Priti Patel continues to push through an immigration bill that wouldn’t have allowed her own parents into the country. Priti is now reportedly considering sending asylum seekers to offshore detention centers modelled on Australia’s cruel, inhuman and degrading policies and has been widely criticised this week after her comments at the Conservative party conference in which she said she would “expedite the removal” of asylum seekers. Meanwhile, the government reviewer of the discriminatory Prevent programme admitted he was “ biased towards ” the programme. Trevor Phillips has been trusted to work across an inquiry into the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME communities, despite being suspended from the Labour Party for Islamophobia. Given the first four doctors to die from the disease were Muslim, the appointment is offensive at best, fatal for communities at worst. It is no wonder Black , Muslim and other marginalised communities feel unsafe and threatened. Boris’s government is bad faith appointments and brownwashing as far as the eye can see. How has this happened? A closer look at the current cabinet hints at a slightly different story to the one being told. Despite Black Britons representing 3% of the population, British Indians 2.3% and British Pakistanis 1.9%, the ethnic minorities in Boris’s cabinet are all British Indian. And even then, only a particular subset makes the cut. The four British Indians are either East African Asian, Hindu, or both. They are also almost all staunch Brexiteers. Britain’s modern diversity, this is not. “A light sprinkling of brown faces doth not a progressive cabinet make” Admittedly, the cabinet’s ethnic minorities were previously drawn from a broader church, including British Pakistani Sajid Javid, but none of those members made it past the first reshuffle. Sajid’s dismissal was rumoured to be connected to his demanding an investigation into Tory-party Islamophobia, but others were dismissed without explanation. Cambridge English professor Priyamvada Gopal observes in The Independent that coupled with the current makeup of the cabinet, Boris’s choices only serve to perform “inclusion without changing the exploitative and racist politics of the One Nation Conservatism”. It was a bait and switch, focused on the performance of progress rather than what would create meaningful change for the communities this “diversity” was meant to reflect. In other words, a light sprinkling of brown faces doth not a progressive cabinet make. In the wake of the brutal murder of George Floyd in the United States, this hypothesis was put to the test. Black communities and their allies across the UK demanded justice and structural change, not just for him but for many in the UK whose fate mirrored his. This was the moment for the cabinet to shine, to reflect the progressive values they were regarded to represent. Instead, their response exposed the fantasy at the heart of the fairytale – representation had never meant progress for the marginalised. Boris Johnson immediately distanced the country from the protests, ignoring Britain’s own record of police brutality and pivoting instead to the red herring of statues . Priti Patel declared the protests unlawful and threatened protesters with “justice” for their “thuggery” against the police, language deceivingly framing the #BlackLivesMatter movement as villainous and violent. Dominic Raab claimed taking the knee came from Game of Thrones, and Matt Hancock named two Asians when asked about Black cabinet ministers. This ignorance and insolence went unpunished. Eventually, Boris announced a commission into racial equality , then kneecapped the effort almost immediately by appointing Munira Mirza, a woman who believes institutional racism is a myth , to lead it. British journalist and author of Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race , Reni Eddo-Lodge likened the move to “asking Jack the Ripper to weigh in on feminism”. The entire episode did little more than reveal the racist rot infesting Whitehall and remind us that staggering disregard for Black people would continue to be a hallmark of Johnson’s government. “Ethnic minorities finding parliamentary success today are largely descendant from one specific group” Sadly, these decisions and declarations are unsurprising to anyone familiar with the failure of the politics of representation, which allows for the elevation of individuals from one minority group while pursuing discriminatory policies against others. It is a colonial sleight of hand as old as the Empire itself, harkening back to practices of divide and rule that enabled imperial expansion. Today’s political goal is Brexit, and imperial habits are hard to break. The ethnic minorities finding parliamentary success today are largely descendant from one specific group with a particular imperial history: East African Asians descended from Indians, long employed by the British to oversee the East Africa Protectorate on their behalf. They acted as sub-imperial agents, maintaining and reinforcing the colonial hierarchy until Kenyan independence in 1963. Africanisation policies and Idi Amin’s expulsion forced thousands of these now “twice migrants” to the shores of Britain. This was a cohort perfectly poised to benefit from Margaret Thatcher’s “ enterprise economy” , bringing with them wealth , strong English language skills and “family values”, as well as lived experience of a colonial hierarchy that rewarded domination of Black Africans. Narindar Saroop, the first Asian Tory Parliamentary candidate, felt that these upwardly mobile Sikh and Hindu Indians were “natural conservatives”, and so in 1976, the Anglo-Asian Conservative Society was born. Saroop was quite the character. An ardent Anglophile, he once described himself as the kind of man who “sits on a tiger-skin rug, wearing a monocle, eating chicken tandoori and humming ‘God Save the Queen’”. He was also a key player in attracting conservative Asians to the party, facilitating meetings with Thatcher herself, and helping them buy into her vision of a self-reliant and entrepreneurial Britain. Their businesses and investments grew, and soon British Indians would become Britain’s wealthiest ethnic minority group, and a growing voter base for the Tories. In less than a decade, the British Indian Conservative vote almost tripled, from 9% in 1979 to 24% by 1987 . The strategy was so successful that David Cameron repeated it in 2010. “The party used the identities of cabinet members as inoculation from any charges of racism” By 2017, the Conservative share of the British Indian vote was up to 40% , reflecting the growing Conservative Hindu and Sikh constituency. Although not all Conservative voters, British Indians were also the most pro-Brexit ethnic minority group, with 40% voting Leave. So when Boris won a landslide victory on the promise to “Get Brexit Done”, elevating British Indians to visibly senior positions and brownwashing the cabinet was a no-brainer. But this was not the anti-racist overture it was presented as – it was regression masquerading as progress. The party moved further right, pursuing anti-immigrant, xenophobic and Islamophobic policies and used the identities of cabinet members as inoculation from any charges of racism. As Priyamvada reminds us , “A place at the majority table often comes at the price of silence or active complicity.” Unless members of minority communities are using their positions of power to alleviate oppressions of other marginalised groups, representation is not genuine progress. In fact, the focus on a simple metric can often be a smokescreen for activism, and the current cabinet shows us as such. Remember, empire building was not only about taking advantage of divisions between communities but actively creating and exacerbating conflict for control. So while some might argue that having four British Indian members of the cabinet is at least some progress, it feels markedly closer to the indirect rule of the empire than any form of liberation. Whether for imperial expansion or Brexit Nativism, as a Black woman, one thing is clear — being ruled by brown faces instead of white is simply a return to the imperial playbook, not progress at all.',

          'Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) said she has the autoimmune disorder alopecia areata, which has rendered her hairless. Pressley revealing her bald head publicly opened the troubling conversation about black hair – especially for African American women. Related: A Texas school has banned a young boy until he cuts his long hair Our children across America are being humiliated and punished because of racist rules and policies that discriminate against their hair texture and natural hairstyles. Last year the video of an African American high school wrestler forced to cut off his dreadlocks to compete went viral. The referee, who was white, said, “His hair and headgear did not comply with rules, and that if he wanted to compete, he would have to immediately cut his dreadlocks – or forfeit.” Pressley, known for her signature Senegalese twists – as her personal identity and political brand – has been criticized as being “too ethnic” and “too urban.” However, to young black girls, Pressley’s hairstyle was both an inspiration and an affirmation to rock proudly. Rep. Ayanna Pressley Congressional Portrait African American women and girls endure some of the harshest punishments concerning our hair, thereby permitting racist workplaces, institutions, and educators to discriminate against us without repercussion. In 2017, Mystic Valley Regional Charter School, in Malden, banned black twins Deanna and Maya Cook from playing after school sports and from attending their prom because they wore hair extensions to school, violating school policy. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey stepped in on the twins’ behalf. Healey sent a letter to the school flatly stating that its policy “includes a number of prohibitions that are either unreasonably subjective or appear to effectively single out students of color.” In the blockbuster hit Black Panther , the beauty of black unstraightened natural hair was placed front and center. Lupita Nyong’o as Nakia wore Bantu knots. Letitia Wright as Shuri donned individual braids and Danai Gurira flaunted a bald head. While many African American women today wear their hair in afros, cornrows, locks, braids, Senegalese twists, wraps, or bald, our hair – both symbolically and literally – continues to be a battlefield in this country’s politics of hair and beauty aesthetics. For example, in 2007, radio personality shock jock Don Imus insulted the Rutgers women’s basketball team, calling them “some nappy-headed hos.” He struck a raw nerve in the African American community – our hair. “Nappy” derogatorily referenced as a racial epithet, as Imus did, is the other n-word in the African American community. Many sisters today might use a hot comb on their hair, which were around in the 1880s and sold in Sears and Bloomingdale’s catalogs to a predominantly white female clientele. Madam C.J. Walker, the first African American millionaire for her inventions of black hair products, didn’t invent the hot comb; she popularized its use by remedying the perceived “curse” of nappy hair with her hair-straightening products that continue to this day bring comfort to many black women. Black hairstyles are not criticized when they are being appropriated by white culture, especially when white celebs or models wear our coiffed styles. In 1979 actress Bo Derek donned cornrows in her breakthrough film 10 . In 1980 People magazine credited Derek for making the style a “cross-cultural craze.” In 2018 when Kim Kardashian posted a video of herself flaunting braids to Snapchat, she credited them as wearing “Bo Derek braids.” Just last week at the men’s fall/winter 2020/2021 fashion show in Paris models presented creations by Comme Des Garçons wearing cornrow wigs. Renowned African American feminist author Alice Walker spoke about the constraints of hair and beauty ideals in African American culture. In her address “Oppressed hair puts a ceiling on the brain,” Walker, at the women’s historically black college Spelman in Atlanta in April 1987, stated the following: I am going to talk to you about hair. Don’t give a thought to the state of yours at the moment. This is not an appraisal… it occurred to me that in my physical self, there remained one last barrier to my spiritual liberation: my hair. I realized I have never been given the opportunity to appreciate my hair for its true self. Eventually, I knew precisely what hair wanted: it wanted to grow, to be itself… to be left alone by anyone, including me, who did not love it as it was. In California, the CROWN ACT (“Create a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair”), a law prohibiting discrimination based on hairstyle and hair texture, went into effect on January 1. Femininity and attractiveness are integrally linked to hair as a Eurocentric aesthetic. Pressley, however, disrupts this notion because she’s stunningly gorgeous and regal – with or without hair. “I’m not here just to occupy space,” Pressley stated in a video interview with The Root . “I’m here to create it.”',

          'Fot. Getty Najnowsze dane pokazują, że gospodarka Wielkiej Brytanii urosła w II kwartale tego roku o 4,8 proc. Ekonomiści nie mają wątpliwości, że jest to efekt złagodzenia, a następnie zniesienia ograniczeń lockdownu w handlu detalicznym i w branży hospitality. Zgodnie z najnowszymi danymi zebranymi przez the Office for National Statistics, gospodarka UK urosła w miesiącu czerwcu o 1 pkt proc., co tylko potwierdziło stały, obserwowany już od pięciu miesięcy trend wzrostowy. Jednocześnie PKB Wielkiej Brytanii wzrosło w II kwartale tego roku o 4,8 proc. I choć jest to niezły wynik, to jednak nieco niższy, niż prognozowali eksperci Banku Anglii. Ci bowiem spodziewali się, że po stopniowym łagodzeniu i wreszcie po pełnym otwarciu handlu detalicznego i branży hospitality, PKB Wielkiej Brytanii urośnie o 5 pkt proc. ZOBACZ TEŻ: Od poniedziałku wszyscy w pełni zaszczepieni dorośli zostaną zwolnieni z obowiązku samo-izolacji. Ale jest jeden warunek Najnowsze dane pokazują, że nasza gospodarka jest w naprawie i że wykazuje silne oznaki ożywienia. Wiem, że wciąż istnieją wyzwania do pokonania, ale jestem pewny, że gospodarka brytyjska jest silna, a Brytyjczycy są odporni – zaznaczył kanclerz skarbu Rishi Sunak w komentarzu do opublikowanych przez ONS danych. Powrót do normalności w UK po Covidzie to jeszcze długa droga Choć dane dotyczące wzrostu gospodarczego w II kwartale tego roku napawają optymizmem, to należy mieć na uwadze, że powrót do normalności w UK jeszcze trochę zajmie. Przede wszystkim wiele gospodarstw domowych będzie się musiało zmierzyć od końca września ze zniesieniem programu pomocy państwowej furlough i ze wzrostem bezrobocia po posezonowym ograniczeniu działalności firm z branży hospitality. Związki zawodowe już apelują do rządu o rozważenie wprowadzenia stałego programu urlopów furlough w niepełnym wymiarze godzin, aby chronić miejsca pracy podczas recesji i innych nieprzewidzianych zdarzeń. Nie przegap: W UK ma miejsce „polowanie” na kierowców ciężarówek. Czy podwyższenie wynagrodzenia to odpowiedni lek na kryzys?',
